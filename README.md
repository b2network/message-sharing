# Message Sharing

Message-sharing is a mechanism for cross-chain messaging on blockchain networks.

## Deployment

### Smart Contract

See the contents of  [docs/message-sharing/smart-contract.md](./docs/message-sharing/smart-contract.md)

### Dapp Deployment

See the contents of [docs/message-sharing/dapp-deployment.md](./docs/message-sharing/dapp-deployment.md)

## Examples

What you need to know before looking at the examples, See the contents
of [docs/examples/attention.md](./docs/examples/attention.md)

### message-channel

This is a simple example of message encoding and transmission. It demonstrates how to transmit messages between
different blockchains, helping developers understand the basic concepts and implementation methods of cross-chain
message transmission.

See the contents of [docs/examples/message-channel/README.md](./docs/examples/message-channel/README.md)

### nft-bridge

This example implements cross-chain functionality for NFTs following the ERC1155 and ERC721 standards. It shows how to
transfer and manage NFTs across different blockchains, providing a solution for multi-chain NFT interoperability.

See the contents of [docs/examples/nft-bridge/README.md](./docs/examples/nft-bridge/README.md)

### token-bridge

This example demonstrates cross-chain functionality for Native and ERC20 Tokens. It explains how to transfer and manage
tokens between different blockchains, ensuring cross-chain liquidity and availability of tokens.

See the contents of [docs/examples/token-bridge/README.md](./docs/examples/token-bridge/README.md)

### orderbook

This example implements multi-chain cashiering, aggregated chain order book, and cashier settlement functionalities. It
shows how to manage and settle orders across multiple blockchains, helping developers build decentralized financial
applications with cross-chain capabilities.

See the contents of [docs/examples/orderbook/README.md](./docs/examples/orderbook/README.md)

Detailed content for each example can be found in the respective documentation. These examples help developers better
understand and implement multi-chain communication services.
